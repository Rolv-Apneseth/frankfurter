  # To paraphrase Wikipedia, most currency pairs are quoted to four decimal
  # places. An exception to this is exchange rates with a value of less than
  # 1.000, which are quoted to five or six decimal places. Exchange rates
  # greater than around 20 are usually quoted to three decimal places and
  # exchange rates greater than 80 are quoted to two decimal places.
  # Currencies over 5000 are usually quoted with no decimal places.

    # places but introduced this refinement to handle an edge case where a
    # lower-rate base currency like IDR produces less precise quotes.
